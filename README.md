# djangoBlog

This is a basic blog web application that allows an administrator to write blog posts, manage the posts and the comments, and to organize the posts based on tags.  A reader of the blog can share a post via email using Django Forms and leave comments for the administrator.  

I wrote this code while from the book Django by Example by Antonio Mele.
